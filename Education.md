# Education Tips

- University is not meant for studying, but it is for
  - Networking (professors, companies, )
  - Presentation Skills
  - research with the best professors  
- There lots of great courses with better professors on the Internet (Youtube: MIT, Onur Mutlu, ...)

## research vs course

- **reliability** : research(paper) & work(سابقه کاری) > Internship > Uni courses === Online course (with certificate) > Online course (without certificate)
  - Online and Uni courses are **not very reliable** because someone else can do it for you, and there is a high chance of cheating.

- research is **wide** =>**making a decision** is so tough and frustrating
