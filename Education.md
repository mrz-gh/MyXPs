- University is meant for studying, but it is for
    - Networking (professors, companies, )
    - Presentation Skills
    - research with the best professors  
- There lots of great courses with better professors on the Internet (Youtube: MIT, Onur Mutlu, ...)


- Online courses are not very reliable because someone else can do it for you.
    - Certificate of Online course is better
- Uni courses are not reliable too because course projects can be done by someone else, and there is a high chance of cheating.
- reliability : research(paper) & work(سابقه کاری) > Internship > Uni courses > Online course (with certificate) > Online course (without certificate)
