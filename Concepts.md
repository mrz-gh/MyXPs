#### why async active-low reset ?

- Design Standards of Many design and synthesis tools
    
- Synchronization: Asynchronous resets are often preferred because they can immediately reset the system regardless of the clock signal. This is crucial for initializing registers and bringing the system to a known state at power-up or during error recovery. A posedge reset, being synchronous, would require the reset signal to align with the clock edge, potentially delaying the reset action and complicating the design.

# Bandwidth Formula and Concepts

The bandwidth of a system (e.g., memory, network, or bus) is calculated based on how much data can be transferred per unit of time.

## üìê General Formula

**Bandwidth**

$$
\text{Bandwidth} = \frac{\text{Data Transferred}}{\text{Time}}
$$

*(in bytes/sec, GB/s, etc.)*



## üß† Key Variations by System

### 1. Memory Bandwidth (e.g., DRAM, HBM, GDDR)

**Formula:**

$$
\text{Memory Bandwidth} = \text{Transfer Rate} \times \text{Bus Width} \times \text{Channels}
$$

* **Transfer Rate**: Clock frequency √ó transfers per clock
  (e.g., DDR5 = 2 transfers/cycle, GDDR6 = 4)
* **Bus Width**: Number of data lines (e.g., 64-bit, 128-bit)
* **Channels**: Number of independent memory channels (e.g., dual-channel, HBM2 stacks)

**Example:**
A DDR4-3200 (3200 MT/s) module with a 64-bit (8-byte) bus and dual-channel:

$$
3200 \times 10^6 \times 8 \times 2 = 51.2 \, \text{GB/s}
$$



### 2. Effective Bandwidth (Real-World Performance)

**Formula:**

$$
\text{Effective Bandwidth} = \frac{\text{Actual Data Transferred}}{\text{Total Time (including overheads)}}
$$

* Accounts for latency, protocol overheads (e.g., PCIe headers), and contention.



### 3. Network Bandwidth

**Formula:**

$$
\text{Network Bandwidth} = \text{Bit Rate} \times \text{Utilization Factor}
$$

* **Bit Rate**: Raw line speed (e.g., 100 Gbps Ethernet)
* **Utilization**: Efficiency after protocol overhead (\~95% for large packets using TCP/IP)


## ‚è± Bandwidth vs. Latency

* **Bandwidth**: Measures *throughput* (how much data moves)
* **Latency**: Measures *delay* (how long one transfer takes)
* ‚ö† High bandwidth ‚â† low latency
  *(e.g., GPUs have high bandwidth but may have higher latency than CPUs)*

### the key issues and trends in DRAM technology scaling
1. the difficulty of scaling DRAM capacity (i.e., density, or cost per bit), bandwidth, and latency at the same time..
2. DRAM technology scaling to smaller nodes adversely affects DRAM reliability.
3. the reliability problems caused by aggressive DRAM technology scaling can lead to new robustness-related (including security and safety problems) vulnerabilities.
4. the power and energy consumption of main memory. DRAM is inherently a power and energy hog, as it consumes energy even when it is not used (e.g., it requires periodic memory refresh [54]), due to its charge-based nature.


‚ö° Fascinatingly, many operations envisioned by these
PUD works can already be performed in real unmodi-
fied commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) DRAM chips, **by**
**violating manufacturer-recommended DRAM timing pa-**
**rameters.**


The first major new approach to main memory design
is 3D-stacked memory [91, 355, 358‚Äì361, 726]. In a
3D-stacked memory, multiple layers of memory (typi-
cally DRAM in already-existing systems) are stacked
on top of each other, as shown in Figure 13. **These**
**layers are connected together using vertical through-**
**silicon vias (TSVs)** [355, 361]. Using current manufac-
turing process technologies, thousands of TSVs can be
placed within a single 3D-stacked memory chip. As
such, the TSVs provide much greater internal mem-
ory bandwidth than the narrow memory channel. Ex-
amples of 3D-stacked DRAM available commercially
include High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) [355, 358],
Wide I/O [727], Wide I/O 2 [728], and the Hybrid Mem-
ory Cube (HMC) [360]. Detailed analysis of such 3D-
stacked memories and their effects on modern work-
loads can be found in [19, 80, 354, 355, 361, 489, 729].
Emerging die-stacking and packaging technologies, like
hybrid bonding [323, 362, 363] and monolithic 3D in-
tegration [364‚Äì371], can further amplify the benefits
of conventional TSV-based 3D-stacked memory chips
by greatly improving internal bandwidth across layers
using high-density inter-layer vias (ILVs) [364, 370]
or direct wafer-to-wafer connections via Cu‚ÄìCu bond-
ing [323, 362, 363, 730], respectively.

‚úî **TSVs alone do not increase CPU-to-memory bandwidth, but they enable much higher internal DRAM bandwidth, which indirectly helps.**  
‚úî **The real bandwidth improvement comes from wider interfaces (like in HBM), which connect to the CPU using interposers or direct stacking.**

üìå Always compare based on first principles and logic because it never changes and if something is inherently suitable for something, it can get mature and predominant. If something is mature and long-lived, it does not mean it is the best and there is no alternative to it. because in this way, there will be no progress and research

### **When Can We Access Data in DRAM?**

The correct order of operations in a **DRAM read cycle** is:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Row Activation:** The entire row is activated, connecting capacitors to the bit-lines.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Sensing:** The sense amplifiers detect and amplify the small charge, holding the row‚Äôs data.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Read:** At this point, the data is **available** to the processor.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Precharge (Before the Next Access):** The bit-lines must be reset (precharged) **before a new row can be accessed**.

#### **Key Correction:**

‚úî **Data is available after sensing, not after precharge.**  
‚úî **Precharge happens only when switching to a different row, not for the same row.**

If I previously said **precharge is needed before reading**, that was incorrect. **Precharge is only needed before accessing a different row**.
:ÔøºÔøº Charge storage (capacitor-based) is inherently slower than bistable transistor-based storage (flip-flop or latch).
Would you like a corrected timing diagram to make this clearer? üöÄ


Yes, DRAM is slower than SRAM due to fundamental design differences rooted in **first principles of circuit operation**. The main reasons why DRAM is slower than SRAM are:

### **1. Storage Cell Structure**

- **SRAM (Static RAM):** Uses **six transistors (6T)** per bit, forming a **latch-based circuit** that can hold data as long as power is supplied. No need for refresh.
    
- **DRAM (Dynamic RAM):** Uses **one transistor and one capacitor (1T1C)** per bit. The capacitor stores charge, but it leaks over time, requiring periodic **refresh cycles**.
    

üìå **First Principle:** Charge storage (capacitor-based) is inherently slower than bistable transistor-based storage (flip-flop or latch).

### **2. Read/Write Mechanism**

- **SRAM:** Directly accesses stored data in a flip-flop, making read/write operations fast.
    
- **DRAM:** Reads data by sensing tiny charge differences in capacitors. This requires **charge amplification and restoration**, slowing down access time.
    

üìå **First Principle:** Charge sensing and refresh add extra latency in DRAM, unlike SRAM‚Äôs direct access.

### **3. Refresh Overhead**

- DRAM capacitors **leak charge over time**, requiring periodic refresh operations (every few milliseconds).
    
- This refresh process **blocks access to memory**, introducing additional latency.
    
- SRAM does not need refresh, making it more responsive.
    

üìå **First Principle:** A volatile charge storage mechanism requires periodic refreshing, increasing latency.

### **4. Access Complexity (Row Activation in DRAM)**

- **SRAM:** Direct access to any bit via its address.
    
- **DRAM:** üìå **First Principle:** Sequential row activation slows down memory access compared to direct addressing. because of extra precharge step.

### **5. Memory Hierarchy and Location**

- **SRAM** is typically used as **cache memory** (L1, L2, L3) **inside the processor**, reducing access time.
    
- **DRAM** is used as **main memory (outside the CPU chip)**, requiring **data movement across buses**, which adds latency.
    

üìå **First Principle:** Physical distance and off-chip data movement increase access time in DRAM compared to on-chip SRAM. because DRAM technology is different from Conventional CMOS, so they cannot be integerated

### **Conclusion**

DRAM is slower than SRAM **not because of SRAM itself**, but due to fundamental differences in **circuit design, charge storage, and access mechanisms**. SRAM‚Äôs **flip-flop storage, direct access, and lack of refresh** make it inherently faster, whereas DRAM‚Äôs **capacitor-based storage, refresh cycles, and row activation overhead** introduce latency.
