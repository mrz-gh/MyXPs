## Verilog/SystemVerilog Tips

- `include vs package
- Each module has to be defined just once using

      `ifndef

      'define

        //Code

      `endif

- xvlog, xelab, xsim - > **uvm in vivado**

- include uvm_macros.svh
- import test, env, ‚Ä¶ packages to the testbench
- UVM phases -> uvm_component
- SV **Queue** & "**semaphore**" (keyword)
- SV **Event**
- **Fork Join** SV (Multi-threading)
- **'ref'** keyword
- use "modport" and "bind" for the interfaces

- SV coverage
- **"final"** in opposite of **"initial"**
- **+incdir**: `include directive

- **"make help"** is necessary.

| func | task|
| -----|-----|
|**no simulation time control** | **Yes simulation time control** |
|one output | multiple outputs |
|can be used in an expression | not used in expressions |

- **Verible** : open source SystemVerilog parser

- file formats and extensions in Hardware area:
  - .emac or .el , .org, .md, .tcl, .ini, .f

- in SV, there is no built-in function to get thread ID when using fork-join

- **Virtual** means it is not associated with any particular datatype.

- variable handler vs real variable (new())

- need to make an optimized testbench in Questa, then simulate

- the **length of variables and literals** must be accute in verilog and SV

- '@' means until first change simulation goes vs Delay (#5 ns)

## Automation

- **TCL** over **.do** files in QuestaSim/ModelSim
  - standalone TCL vs TCL/TK

|TCL| .do file|
|---|---------|
|More General (A scripting language)| specific to ModelSim & Questa |

- CMake vs Make(Makefile)
  - CMake: buildsystem generator ==> compability for various OSes
  - Make: buildsystem ==> limited compability

# Hardware Concepts

- **round-robin arbiter**
- **sanity testing** is a **rapid** and **initial assessment** of the basic functionality of a software system.

### Chiplets vs Monolithic Chip

 ‚úÖ Heterogeneous Integration

- You can build different chiplets with different technologies or process nodes (e.g., 5nm CPU + 7nm I/O + 16nm analog).  
- This is much harder with a monolithic die, which uses a single process node.  
üí° Example: AMD uses TSMC 5nm for compute chiplets, and 6nm or 12nm for I/O chiplets in EPYC CPUs.

 ‚öîÔ∏è Scalability & Flexibility
‚úÖ In monolithic chips, different modules (like CPU, GPU, memory controllers) can be designed in parallel.
But chiplets still win in manufacturing scalability:
- Monolithic chips scale poorly in terms of area because:  
- There's a reticle limit (~800 mm¬≤).  
- As chip area grows, yield drops exponentially.  

Chiplets scale better economically ‚Üí e.g., AMD builds 64-core EPYC CPUs from 8-core chiplets (modular replication).

### 3D-integeration:
- **TSV-based Stacking**
- M3D (Monolithic 3D-staking)
- 2.5 D

 1Ô∏è‚É£ How is Monolithic 3D Integration Different from TSV-based Stacking?


| Feature           | TSV-Based 3D Stacking (HBM, Wide I/O)            | Monolithic 3D Integration (M3D)                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stacking Method   | Separate dies stacked & connected via TSVs       | Transistor layers grown sequentially on the same wafer         |
| Interconnect Type | TSVs (large & power-hungry)                      | High-density Inter-Layer Vias (ILVs)                           |
| Layer Bonding     | Die-to-die bonding                               | Wafer-to-wafer bonding                                         |
| Density           | Limited by TSV size (~1‚Äì10 ¬µm)                   | Much higher density (ILVs < 100 nm)                            |
| Performance       | High bandwidth, but TSVs add delay & energy cost | Lower latency, higher bandwidth due to ultra-dense connections |
| Power Efficiency  | Improved vs. 2D but still power-hungry           | Extremely low energy consumption                               |
| Use Cases         | GPUs, AI accelerators, high-bandwidth DRAM       | Future CPUs, AI chips, neuromorphic computing                  |

  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Differences Between Bumps & Microbumps

| Feature          | Bump                        | Microbump                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Size             | 50‚Äì150 ¬µm                   | 10‚Äì30 ¬µm                                            |
| Application      | Flip-chip CPU/GPU, 2.5D ICs | 3D-stacked DRAM, chiplets                           |
| Density          | Lower                       | Much higher (more per area)                         |
| Power Efficiency | Higher resistance           | Lower resistance, better for low-power applications |

‚úî Chiplet Design = A modular approach to CPU/GPU design (uses smaller dies instead of one big chip).

‚úî 2.5D Integration = A packaging method where multiple chips are placed on a silicon **interposer** for high-speed communication.

So:

‚úÖ Chiplets are not connected via traditional PCB.
‚úÖ Chiplets use silicon **interposers, EMIBs, or advanced substrates** for fast and dense interconnects.
