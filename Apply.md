## 2. Tips
- Research and GPA (Not just one of them, even if you are a bachelor) -> USA
  - Research is very important for professors -> Admission 
    - because the professor should recommend you first
  - GPA is important for the Uni -> fellowship

- Admitted Uni is not very impactful on the **visa process** unless the university is great or a disaster (e.g. UVA vs NYU is little)

- Have questions about the group of professors
- Official Enrollment Certificate is required for Italy Uni application, procedure: 
  - گواهی اشتغال به تحصیل با نیاز به ترجمه از بهستان
  - قسمت 'تایید مدارک تحصیلی دانشگاهی داخل برای ترجمه رسمی' -> نامه لغو تعهد لازم دارد
    - با قسمت 'صدور گواهی اشتغال به تحصیل' اشتباه نشود
  - ترجمه رسمی با مهر رسمی دارالترجمه
  - می تواند با مهر دادگستری و وزارت خارجه باشد ولی برای اپلای لازم نیست بلکه برای سفارت است که مدارک باید مهر دادگستری و وزارت خارجه داشته باشند.
- DSU: بورسیه استانی ایتالیا
  - For every district is different -> required documents are different 
    - Milan has the fewest required docs ->  Easiest
    - Polimi has a merit-based scholarship too.( it is different from DSU)
- Recom letters
  - First, talk to your professors about how many they can write recommendation letters then become a TA
  - Second, always be in contact with your professors and they see you frequently when you are a TA
- ISEE: عدد ایزه

### 3.2 Application Correction Emails

“Correction: Change of Study Location”

Dear Admission Director,

I am writing to request a correction regarding the location of my study in my previous application. I mistakenly selected the wrong location and would like to make the necessary change. My application reference ID is 899192707.

I apologize for any confusion caused. I intended to select West Lafayette where the Elmore Family School of ECE is placed as my preferred study location instead of Indianapolis. The Elmore School's esteemed faculty, exceptional programs, and vibrant campus community align perfectly with my academic interests and aspirations.

I kindly request your guidance in correcting study locations. Thank you for your understanding and assistance in rectifying this mistake. I appreciate your attention to this matter and eagerly await further instructions on the necessary steps to correct my application.

Please feel free to contact me if you require any additional information.
Thank you for your support.

### 3.3 Request 

#### Polimi (have a word constraint) 
As an international student, I need to provide a translated enrollment certificate as proof of their academic status. However, my university doesn't issue the certificate until the term registration process is complete on February 29th. Additionally, the university's administrative process for translating and validating the certificate takes around 10 days, which exceeds the application deadline. Can I submit the enrollment certificate from the previous semester until I get the document.

## 4. Question to ask from professors

- Can you tell me about any unique or standout experience you've had as a member of the CEI Lab community?, and how collaborative is the environment? 

- how accessible are the professors? Because CEI-Lab is a large group, I wanted to know what mechanisms is used to access the professors
 
- Structure of future computing hw, notably embedded systems and how they will be organized 
- Expectations and also What kind of students thrive here in such a large and prestigious group?

- Open to new subjects and how often the group revise its projects and perspectives

- Can you share some insights about the team's career outcomes for graduates?

- Can you explain a little bit about the "deep insights" as one of the applications of PRISM research?

- How do you plan to combine these accelerators to achieve next generation complex systems??? 

- Dominant HW architecture and technologies of future computing hw and the role of Quantum computers? 

- Expectations and also What kind of students thrive here in such a large and prestigious group?

- When can I expect getting the answer about my application from you? 



## Interview Questions
### Why this Uni?
Because your research interest is aligned with mine. I am fond of Unconventional computing methods, notably memristors/spintronic and MTJ/..., and I found your work on this topic very interesting.

### Why are you a good fit? / Why are you interested in our research?
Digital Systems -> familiar with computing modules and algorithms and logical gates and computer architecture / volatile and non-volatile memories
VLSI -> nanoscale fabrication process of transistors and gates  and low-level synthesis and simulations and power simulation and optimization methods
EPS -> stochastic computing and analysis 


### Contribution
by doing skillful researches. Because I want to become a professor, I will make strenuous efforts to do high-quality researches. 
Also, as I stated my teacher assistantships in my CV, I am fond of being a teacher assistant.


### short-term goal and long-term goal
short-term goal: acquiring more research skills and foster my knowledge about unconventional computing devices and methods notably memristors/spintronic computing

### accomplishments
I am ranked first among graduating students in the electrical engineering major.
I have achieved rank 333 in the national university entrance exam.

### Weaknesses
I am a bit perfectionist, so sometimes, I get frustrated when I can't fully understand sth. Therefore, I need some rest to recover. Therefore, I've upgraded my study methods in order to find what I want instead of memorizing and getting less useful knowledge.

### Failures
My biggest failure was not continuing the Mathematics Olympiad in high school. My family insisted on studying lessons in high school along with the Mathematics Olympiad, so I couldn't devote enough time to that, and I failed the second step.

### Undergraduate Research
I am working on measuring power of a RISC-v Processor in order to categorize and identify the power of each macro that is part of an instruction then integrate the values into ISS of the processor written by myself.  
The second phase of the project is power optimization of the processor.
the power is measured using the PrimeTime software.



### Research Interests and enthusiasm
post-CMOS 
I am originally fond of electronic physics and computing. After I found out about the constraints of new nano transistors and the post-Denard era. I did some research and watched some seminars, found out about new emerging technologies on the area of computing. Then I got interested in memristors because they can be implemented with current CMOS fabrication process, but they are far more energy efficient and faster than transistors. 



### Pursuing your study in graduate studies
I want to become a professor and, moreover, work on the edge of technology. Therefore, there is no better way to do more research and pursue my studies in graduate.


### How do your professors describe you?
Generally, they describe me as a persistent person. For example, when I was working on ISS of a processor, I would constantly follow up the process of getting codes and what I need. 

Secondly, I am described as a person who is on time. For example, I have never deliver assignments and grades of students late as a teacher assistant.
