### Why this Uni?
Because your research interest is aligned with mine. I am fond of Unconventional computing methods, notably memristors/spintronic and MTJ/..., and I found your work on this topic very interesting.

### Why are you a good fit? / Why are you interested in our research?
Digital Systems -> familiar with computing modules and algorithms and logical gates and computer architecture / volatile and non-volatile memories
VLSI -> nanoscale fabrication process of transistors and gates  and low-level synthesis and simulations and power simulation and optimization methods
EPS -> stochastic computing and analysis 


### Contribution
by doing skillful researches. Because I want to become a professor, I will make strenuous efforts to do high-quality researches. 
Also, as I stated my teacher assistantships in my CV, I am fond of being a teacher assistant.


### short-term goal and long-term goal
short-term goal: acquiring more research skills and foster my knowledge about unconventional computing devices and methods notably memristors/spintronic computing

### accomplishments
I am ranked first among graduating students in the electrical engineering major.
I have achieved rank 333 in the national university entrance exam.

### Weaknesses
I am a bit perfectionist, so sometimes, I get frustrated when I can't fully understand sth. Therefore, I need some rest to recover. Therefore, I've upgraded my study methods in order to find what I want instead of memorizing and getting less useful knowledge.

### Failures
My biggest failure was not continuing the Mathematics Olympiad in high school. My family insisted on studying lessons in high school along with the Mathematics Olympiad, so I couldn't devote enough time to that, and I failed the second step.

### Undergraduate Research
I am working on measuring power of a RISC-v Processor in order to categorize and identify the power of each macro that is part of an instruction then integrate the values into ISS of the processor written by myself.  
The second phase of the project is power optimization of the processor.
the power is measured using the PrimeTime software.



### Research Interests and enthusiasm
post-CMOS 
I am originally fond of electronic physics and computing. After I found out about the constraints of new nano transistors and the post-Denard era. I did some research and watched some seminars, found out about new emerging technologies on the area of computing. Then I got interested in memristors because they can be implemented with current CMOS fabrication process, but they are far more energy efficient and faster than transistors. 



### Pursuing your study in graduate studies
I want to become a professor and, moreover, work on the edge of technology. Therefore, there is no better way to do more research and pursue my studies in graduate.


### How do your professors describe you?
Generally, they describe me as a persistent person. For example, when I was working on ISS of a processor, I would constantly follow up the process of getting codes and what I need. 

Secondly, I am described as a person who is on time. For example, I have never deliver assignments and grades of students late as a teacher assistant.
