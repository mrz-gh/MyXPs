# My Workspace
## Note

infinitive canvas: **Concepts**

> #### Excalidraw vs Concepts
> 
> Concept is smoother (better UX)
>
> Excalidraw 
> - free and open-source but it is not mature yet.
> - Searchability
> - Compatible with Obsidian


Draft Notes --> Obsidian md files


> #### Markdown vs Mic Word vs LibreOffice vs TeX vs gdoc
> 
> - Mic Word is closed source and not free 
> - LibreOffice is good for opening word documents
> - gdoc is free but not open-source. Also, you should get online to save the document completely
> - Markdown is open-source and free
> - TeX is open-source and free too. But it is very good for research papers and complex docs
>
> LibreOffice for working with Mic Word docs from outside
>
> Markdown for every-day use
>
> TeX for complex docs (e.g. papers, reports, etc.)

## Management

- My Journals: Google Drive (**Easier to access** than **.md** files on the **phone**)



## Softwares
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

- IDEs: VScode, Visual Studio Community, ModelSim, QuestaSim (not free), MatLab (not free) 

- PDF tools:
  - PDF annotator -> Writing with Pen
  - Adobe Acrobat Pro. -> Not free

- VPN: Geph, NetMod
  - linux: Windscribe, Geph

- WinRAR, Potplayer, TeXstudio, MikTeX, KMSAutoLite, Git, Grammarly, IDM (not free), draw.io rather than visio, Spotify



- Microsoft apps on your phone and OneDrive are useless. Instead of them, use â€œGoogle Drive''.

## Tips
- Set proxy of **IDM** to **System Proxy**.

- **Blocking Internet** of Specific Programs.



- Python: **Miniconda**
	- Use Miniconda for python and data science. Miniconda installation requires the Internet.
	

- Avoid using **duplicate files** because you get confused over time when you forget what is the difference between them. Instead, use **referencing** with **version control** systems like Git. 


- **Commenting** is critical, even when you get back to your code, you can understand it more rapidly.
  - use '' for poper nouns in comments

- TODO.md
- Ultimate **'ReadMe'** format:
  - Outline
  - Overview
    - Goal/Motivation of the project
  - Directory Guide
  - 
## My Skills

- Tensorflow, pytorch
- EDA tools: Q-flow, Synopsis Design Compiler and PrimeTime PX
- Altera, Quartus, MatLab
- Verification: System verilog assertions, UVM
- Gem5 to work with multiprocessors systems





- DataBase is much more suitable for working with data, not text files and manually sum and work with them


### HDL simulator

- Cadence Xcelium (xrun)
- Cadence Incisive
- Mentor Graphics Questa (vsim) -> uvm, mixed HDL language simulation
- Mentor Graphics ModelSim(vsim) -> mixed HDL language simulation
- Synopsys VCS (vcs) -> uvm, mixed HDL language simulation
- Aldec Riviera-PRO (riviera) -> uvm
- Aldec Active-HDL -> mixed HDL language simulation
- Xilinx Vivado Simulator -> uvm, mixed HDL language simulation

### HDL Synthesizers

- Xilinx Vivado Synthesis -> Xilinx FPGAs and Xilinx SoCs
- Synopsys Design Compiler -> ASIC & FPGA
- Cadence Genus 
- Intel Quartus Prime -> Intel FPGA
- Yosys -> ASIC, FPGA, ...





Do not use '-' and whitespace in identifiers.

identifier vs text 

terminal cannot show images and tables like pandas styled DataFrames 
so it is better to use jupyter notebooks


openpyxl is a pure Python library that does not rely on the Excel API or require an installed version of Excel. It directly reads and writes Excel files in the .xlsx format by parsing the underlying XML structure defined by the Office Open XML (OOXML) file format specifications.
Excel is a proprietary spreadsheet software

`Styler.apply` and `.map` are not compatible with non-unique index or columns.

in TCL, use ; at the end of each line

Why English ???


Matplotlib was downloaded with MCI (Irancell was very unstable)
