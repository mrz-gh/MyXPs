# My Workspace
## Note

infinitive canvas: **Concepts**

> #### Excalidraw vs Concepts
> 
> Concept is smoother (better UX)
>
> Excalidraw 
> - free and open-source but it is not mature yet.
> - Searchability
> - Compatible with Obsidian


Draft Notes --> Obsidian md files


> #### Markdown vs Mic Word vs LibreOffice vs TeX vs gdoc
> 
> - Mic Word is closed source and not free 
> - LibreOffice is good for opening word documents
> - gdoc is free but not open-source. Also, you should get online to save the document completely
> - Markdown is open-source and free
> - TeX is open-source and free too. But it is very good for research papers and complex docs
>
> LibreOffice for working with Mic Word docs from outside
>
> Markdown for every-day use
>
> TeX for complex docs (e.g. papers, reports, etc.)

## Softwares
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

- IDEs: VScode, Visual Studio Community, ModelSim, QuestaSim (not free), MatLab (not free) 

- PDF tools:
  - PDF annotator -> Writing with Pen

- VPN: Geph, NetMod
  - linux: Windscribe, Geph

- WinRAR, Potplayer, TeXstudio, MikTeX, KMSAutoLite, Git, Grammarly, IDM (not free), draw.io rather than visio, Spotify



- Microsoft apps on your phone and OneDrive are useless. Instead of them, use â€œGoogle Drive''.

## Tips
- Set proxy of **IDM** to **System Proxy**.

- **Blocking Internet** of Specific Programs.



- Python: **Miniconda**
	- Use Miniconda for python and data science. Miniconda installation requires the Internet.
	

- Avoid using **duplicate files** because you get confused over time when you forget what is the difference between them. Instead, use **referencing** with **version control** systems like Git. 


- **Commenting** is critical, even when you get back to your code, you can understand it more rapidly.


- Ultimate **'ReadMe'** format:
  - Outline
  - Overview
    - Goal/Motivation of the project
  - Directory Guide

## My Skills

- Tensorflow, pytorch
- EDA tools: Q-flow, Design compiler and primetime
- Altera, Quartus, MatLab
- Verification: System verilog assertions, UVM
- Gem5 to work with multiprocessors systems





- DataBase is much more suitable for working with data, not text files and manually sum and work with them
