## Note

infinitive canvas: **Concepts**

> #### Excalidraw vs Concepts
> 
> Concept is smoother (better UX)
>
> Excalidraw 
> - free and open-source but it is not mature yet.
> - Searchability
> - Compatible with Obsidian


Draft Notes --> Obsidian md files


> #### Markdown vs Mic Word vs LibreOffice vs TeX vs gdoc
> 
> - Mic Word is closed source and not free 
> - LibreOffice is good for opening word documents
> - gdoc is free but not open-source. Also, you should get online to save the document completely
> - Markdown is open-source and free
> - TeX is open-source and free too. But it is very good for research papers and complex docs
>
> LibreOffice for working with Mic Word docs from outside
>
> Markdown for every-day use
>
> TeX for complex docs (e.g. papers, reports, etc.)
